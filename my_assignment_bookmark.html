    <h2 id="IT">Information Technology</h2>
    <p>
        Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices,
        infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data.
        Typically, IT is used in the context of business operations, as opposed to technology used for personal or
        entertainment purposes. The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.

        The Harvard Business Review coined the term information technology to make a distinction between purpose-built
        machines designed to perform a limited scope of functions, and general-purpose computing machines that could be
        programmed for various tasks. As the IT industry evolved from the mid-20th century, computing capability
        increased, while device cost and energy consumption decreased, a cycle that continues today when new
        technologies emerge.
    </p>
    <p>

        What does information technology encompass?
        The IT department ensures that the organization's systems, networks, data and applications all connect and
        function properly. The IT team handles three major areas:

        deploys and maintains business applications, services and infrastructure (servers, networks, storage);
        monitors, optimizes and troubleshoots the performance of applications, services and infrastructure; and
        oversees the security and governance of applications, services and infrastructure.
        Most IT staff have different responsibilities within the team that break into several key areas including:

        Administration. Administrators handle the day-to-day deployment, operation and monitoring of an IT environment,
        including systems, networks and applications. Admins often perform a range of other duties such as software
        upgrades, user training, software license management, procurement, security, data management and observing
        adherence to business process and compliance requirements.
    </p>
    <p>

        Support. Help desk staff specialize in answering questions, gathering information and directing troubleshooting
        efforts for hardware and software. IT support often includes IT asset and change management, helping admins with
        procurement, handling backup and recovery of data and applications, monitoring and analyzing logs and other
        performance monitoring tools and following established support workflows and processes.
        Applications. Businesses rely on software to perform work. Some applications are procured and deployed from
        third parties, such as email server applications. But many organizations retain a staff of skilled developers
        that create the applications and interfaces -- such as APIs -- needed to deliver critical business capabilities
        and services. Applications might be coded in a wide array of popular languages and integrated with other
        applications to create smooth and seamless interactions between different applications. Developers might also be
        tasked with creating interactive business websites and building mobile applications. The trend toward agile or
        continuous development paradigms require developers to be increasingly involved with IT operations, such as
        deploying and monitoring applications.
        Compliance. Businesses are obligated to observe varied government- and industry-driven regulatory requirements.
        IT staff play a major role in securing and monitoring access to business data and applications to ensure that
        such resources are used according to established business governance policy that meets regulatory requirements.
        Such staff are deeply involved with security tasks and routinely interact with legal and business teams to
        prevent, detect, investigate and report possible breaches.
        IT component examples
        IT encompasses many different technologies, capabilities and functions.
        Why is information technology important?
        It's been said that data is what powers industries worldwide. That may be hyperbole, but few businesses -- large
        or small -- can remain competitive without the ability to collect data and turn it into useful information. IT
        provides the means to develop, process, analyze, exchange, store and secure information.

    <p>Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society,
        and its history is intricately linked to advances in the understanding of physics and mathematics throughout
        history. Because civil engineering is a broad profession, including several specialized sub-disciplines, its
        history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, geography, geology, soils, hydrology,
        environmental science, mechanics, project management, and other fields.[6]
    <p>

        Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans,
        such as stonemasons and carpenters, rising to the role of master builder. Knowledge was retained in guilds and
        seldom supplanted by advances. Structures, roads, and infrastructure that existed were repetitive, and increases
        in scale were incremental.[7]
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the earliest examples of a scientific approach to physical and mathematical problems applicable to civil
        engineering is the work of Archimedes in the 3rd century BC, including Archimedes' principle, which underpins
        our understanding of buoyancy, and practical solutions such as Archimedes' screw. Brahmagupta, an Indian
        mathematician, used arithmetic in the 7th century AD, based on Hindu-Arabic numerals, for excavation (volume)
        computations

        Mechanical engineering is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles
        with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.[1] It is one of the
        oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.

        The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics,
        thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles,
        mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and
        product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery,
        heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and
        others. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.[2][3]
    </p>
    <p>
        Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century;
        however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world. In the 19th century,
        developments in physics led to the development of mechanical engineering science. The field has continually
        evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as
        composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. It also overlaps with aerospace engineering, metallurgical
        engineering, civil engineering, structural engineering, electrical engineering, manufacturing engineering,
        chemical engineering, industrial engineering, and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts. Mechanical
        engineers may also work in the field of biomedical engineering, specifically with biomechanics, transport
        phenomena, biomechatronics, bionanotechnology, and modelling of biological systems.

    <p>The origin of aerospace engineering can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the late 19th to early
        20th centuries, although the work of Sir George Cayley dates from the last decade of the 18th to mid-19th
        century. One of the most important people in the history of aeronautics[8] and a pioneer in aeronautical
        engineering,[9] Cayley is credited as the first person to separate the forces of lift and drag, which affect any
        atmospheric flight vehicle.[10]

        Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical, with some concepts and skills imported from
        other branches of engineering.[11] Some key elements, like fluid dynamics, were understood by 18th-century
        scientists.[citation needed]
    </p>
    <p>
        In December 1903, the Wright Brothers performed the first sustained, controlled flight of a powered,
        heavier-than-air aircraft, lasting 12 seconds. The 1910s saw the development of aeronautical engineering through
        the design of World War I military aircraft.

        Between World Wars I and II, great leaps were made in the field, accelerated by the advent of mainstream civil
        aviation. Notable airplanes of this era include the Curtiss JN 4, the Farman F.60 Goliath, and Fokker Trimotor.
        Notable military airplanes of this period include the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, the Supermarine Spitfire and the
        Messerschmitt Bf 109 from Japan, United Kingdom, and Germany respectively. A significant development in
        aerospace engineering came with the first operational Jet engine-powered airplane, the Messerschmitt Me 262
        which entered service in 1944 towards the end of the second World War.[12]

        The first definition of aerospace engineering appeared in February 1958,[4] considering the Earth's atmosphere
        and outer space as a single realm, thereby encompassing both aircraft (aero) and spacecraft (space) under the
        newly coined term aerospace.

        In response to the USSR launching the first satellite, Sputnik, into space on October 4, 1957, U.S. aerospace
        engineers launched the first American satellite on January 31, 1958. The National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration was founded in 1958 as a response to the Cold War. In 1969, Apollo 11, the first human space
        mission to the moon took place. It saw three astronauts enter orbit around the Moon, with two, Neil Armstrong
        and Buzz Aldrin, visiting the lunar surface. The third astronaut, Michael Collins, stayed in orbit to rendezvous

    <h2 id="ECE">Electrical and Electronic Engineering</h2>
    <p>Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of
        equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an
        identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric
        telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.

        Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering,
        systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing,
        instrumentation, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap
        with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power
        electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable
        energies, mechatronics/control, and electrical materials science.[a]
